## Backend Workshops

The below outlines a proposal to deliver a series of ~90 minute workshops over a broad range of backend technologies.

### Audience
The intended audience is anyone with an interest in the concepts, architectures, tools, languages, methodologies, processes and products that make of the landscape of what is often very broadly referred to as backend engineering.
From students to seasoned software engineers looking for some insight in to areas they have yet to explore.  

As such workshops will be assessable and will seek to demystify the myriad of terms and jargon that exist whilst also being rich in content.

### Format
The first part of each workshop will introduce a concept (e.g. containerization) and discuss the value of that concept within the context of a simple use case.  

The second part of each workshop will be concrete example (so in the case of containerization this would be based on Docker) including a step by step tutorial for attendees to follow, during the workshop or later on, with downloadable source code and guide.

Although this is a series of workshops care will be taken to ensure each workshop is stand alone such that attendees to pick the workshops that interest them whilst ignoring those that do not.  This may not always be entirely possible, e.g. in order to understand _container orchestration_ an understanding of _containerization_ will be required.

### Schedule
It is envisaged that these workshops be delivered fortnightly between tues-thurs from ~18:30 enabling students and professionals to attend with the option to socialise after the event.
